NAME
    Glib::EV - Coerce Glib into using the EV module as event loop.

SYNOPSIS
     use Glib::EV;

     # example with Gtk2:
     use Gtk2 -init;
     use Glib::EV;
     use EV; # any order
     my $timer = EV::timer 1, 1, sub { print "I am here!\n" };
     main Gtk2;
     # etc., it just works

     # You can even move the glib mainloop into a coroutine:
     use Gtk2 -init;
     use Coro;
     use Coro::EV;
     use Glib::EV;
     async { main Gtk2 };
     # ... do other things

DESCRIPTION
    If you want to use glib/gtk+ in an EV program, then you need to look at
    the EV::Glib module, not this one, as this module requires you to run a
    Glib or Gtk+ main loop in your program.

    If you want to use EV in an Glib/Gtk+ program, you are at the right
    place here.

    This module coerces the Glib event loop to use the EV high performance
    event loop as underlying event loop, i.e. EV will be used by Glib for
    all events.

    This makes Glib compatible to EV. Calls into the Glib main loop are more
    or less equivalent to calls to "EV::loop" (but not vice versa, you
    *have* to use the Glib mainloop functions).

    * The Glib perl module is not used.
        This module has no dependency on the existing Glib perl interface,
        as it uses glib directly. The Glib module can, however, be used
        without any problems (as long as evereybody uses shared libraries to
        keep everybody else happy).

    * The default context will be changed when the module is loaded.
        Loading this module will automatically "patch" the default context
        of libglib, so normally nothing more is required.

    * Glib does not allow recursive invocations.
        This means that none of your event watchers might call into Glib
        functions or functions that might call glib functions (basically all
        Gtk2 functions). It might work, but that's your problem....

BUGS
      * No documented API to patch other main contexts.
